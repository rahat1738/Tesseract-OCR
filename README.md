# Tesseract-OCR
As part of my project, I used Tesseract-OCR to extract data from PDF files. The goal was to read and store a large amount of data for implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). I also compared this method with an alternative approach that extracts data from PDFs using AI models.

For small datasets, such as PDFs with only a few pages, using an AI model is more efficient. However, when dealing with large datasets—such as reading thousands of pages—Tesseract-OCR proves to be the better option in terms of cost.
